What is the model method for Routes? 

"route is responsible for querying the model"
Routes model method is a hook through which you can perform ajax requests (if you don't use ember-data)
or for querying your store if you do use Ember-Data.
BUT if you 


Computed properties allow you to declare functions as properties, eg:

App.Person = Ember.Object.extend({
  firstName: null,
  lastName: null,

  fullName: function() {
    return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');
  }.property('firstName', 'lastName')
});

//in use:

var ironMan = App.Person.create({
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName:  "Stark"
});

ironMan.get('fullName') // "Tony Stark"


Nested Routes for nested views, the nested templates need an outlet in the\
parent view.

the modelFor method allows you to use the model of another route
For example, to edit a user, whch belongs to the user route, from the userEdit route

WHAT IS THIS? this.transitionToRoute('user', user); //why two users?
